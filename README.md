ABOUT
- This repository contains an overview of my coding projects from my MMET303 coding focused class at Texas A&M.
- Each folder contains a prompt file with all the project prompts and their respective file(s).

CLASS BACKGROUND INFORMATION
- MMET 303 Fluid Mechanics and Power.
- Credits 4. 3 Lecture Hours. 2 Lab Hours. 
- Fluid mechanics and fluid power applications for technologists; fluid properties; conservation of energy and momentum; incompressible flow in pipes; standard symbols: components and control of hydraulic systems and pneumatic systems. 
- (MMET 303, Fluid Mechanics & Power) Use of MATLAB and Automation Studio to conduct experiments in order to gain an understanding of the basic concepts and principles of fluid mechanics. Topics included Fluid property measurements - Viscosity and specific gravity, Pressure measurement and gauge calibration, Flow measuring devices, Fluid Friction and pressure loss, Positive displacement pumps, Dynamic pumps, Fan efficiency, and Advanced Hydraulic circuit diagrams and valves.
